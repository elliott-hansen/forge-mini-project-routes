                    My name is Elliott Hansen, I am a recent graduate from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville VA. I am from Williamsburg, VA (go Tribe!). I love programming and building apps, but I also love going outside and doing anything I can in the sun. I have recently began exploring photography, specifically on film. Here's a photo I recently took on my dad's old Canon AE-1:
